      In the Middle Ages, two civilizations grew that changed the world: the
      Islamic civilization and the Western civilization. These civilizations
      started from very different groups of people. The Bedouins lived in the
      deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, while the Vikings sailed the icy seas of
      Northern Europe.


      The Arabs were inspired by a new message from God and quickly spread
      across Asia and Africa. In just one generation, they defeated powerful
      empires like the Persians and Romans. At the same time, the Vikings were
      famous for exploring and raiding. They ruled Northern Europe for over 200
      years. Their descendants, like the Normans and the Rus, carried on their
      traditions. From these two groups, the Islamic and Western civilizations
      emerged.


      ## What Came Before


      The history of these civilizations covers about 1,400 years. But human
      history is much older. Scientists believe humans have existed for at least
      200,000 years, and maybe even two million years. They base this on old
      tools and other evidence.


      ## Is Western History Always Correct?


      In the 1800s, European countries like Britain, France, and Germany started
      writing about their histories. They often mixed facts with stories to make
      Europeans look like they were the most important people in history. They
      said Europe’s story began with Ancient Greece, which they claimed was
      special for its science and thinking. Then they said these ideas passed to
      the Romans, who were praised for their laws even though they ruled
      harshly. They described the Middle Ages as a bad time, but said Europe
      became great again during the Renaissance by rediscovering Greek and Roman
      ideas. This version of history was taught in schools all over the world.


      ## Common Myths About the West


      Some people believe Western countries inherited all the greatness of
      Greece and Rome. This isn’t true. Greece and Rome were Mediterranean
      civilizations connected to Asia and Africa. Western countries like Britain
      and Germany came from different tribes and cultures.


      People also think the Roman Empire ended in the 400s when Rome was
      invaded. This is only partly true. The western part of the empire ended,
      but the eastern part, with its capital in Constantinople, lasted until
      1453. This part is often called the “Byzantine Empire,” but the people who
      lived there never used that name.


      Maps and history books also make Europe look separate from Asia. But
      Europe is actually a part of Asia. Maps were often drawn to make Europe
      look bigger and more important.


      In the 1800s, some Europeans believed in an “evolution myth.” They thought
      white Europeans were the smartest and best people because of their science
      and governments. This belief was wrong and unfair.


      ## Camels: Ships of the Desert


      The Vikings used longboats to travel the cold northern seas. Arab
      Bedouins, however, relied on camels to cross the desert. Camels are
      amazing animals built for desert life. They can drink up to 40 gallons of
      water in just a few minutes! This helps them survive for a long time
      without water. When they find water, they drink as much as they can to
      stay hydrated.


      Do you know other cool facts about camels?


      ## Rethinking History


      For a long time, Western countries told their version of history. But now,
      people are looking at history from different points of view. Readers can
      think about these stories and decide which ones seem most accurate.
