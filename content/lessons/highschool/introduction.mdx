      During the Early Middle Ages, two major civilizations arose and influenced
      the world: the Islamic and Western civilizations. These civilizations had
      very different beginnings. The Islamic civilization emerged from the
      Bedouin tribes of the Arabian Peninsula, while the Western civilization
      evolved from the seafaring Vikings of Northern Europe.


      The Arabs, inspired by a new religious revelation, expanded rapidly across
      Asia and Africa. In a single generation, they conquered powerful empires
      such as the Persians and Romans. Meanwhile, the Vikings became known for
      their exploration, raiding, and settlement activities, dominating Northern
      Europe for over 200 years. Their descendants, including the Normans in the
      West and the Rus in the East, carried on their legacy. Out of these
      transformative events, the Islamic and Western civilizations developed.


      ## Historical Context


      The history of these civilizations spans roughly 1,400 years. However,
      human history dates back much further. Scientists have traced the
      existence of modern humans (Homo sapiens) to at least 200,000 years ago,
      and evidence of tool-making suggests humans may have existed for nearly
      two million years.


      ## Reexamining Western History


      In the 19th century, European powers like Britain, France, and Germany
      began documenting their own histories. This process often blended facts
      with myths to present Europeans as superior. Ancient Greece was depicted
      as the birthplace of rational thought and science, with these traditions
      passed down to the Romans. While the Middle Ages were seen as a time of
      decline, the Renaissance was portrayed as a period of rediscovery and
      progress. This Eurocentric narrative became the standard in schools across
      the world.


      ## Debunking Myths


      One common myth is that Western civilization is the true inheritor of the
      legacies of Greece and Rome. However, Greece and Rome were Mediterranean
      cultures closely connected to Asia and Africa. Western nations such as
      Britain and Germany originated from Germanic and Nordic tribes, outside
      the influence of Greece and Rome.


      Another myth involves the fall of the Roman Empire. Many believe it ended
      in the 5th century when Rome was sacked. However, this only applies to the
      western part of the empire. The eastern part, with its capital in
      Constantinople (often called “New Rome”), survived for another thousand
      years until it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. This eastern empire
      is often referred to as the Byzantine Empire, though its people never used
      that name.


      Maps and textbooks often suggest Europe is a separate continent, but
      geographically, it is part of Asia. In addition, maps were historically
      drawn to make Europe appear larger and more important than other regions.


      During the 19th century, the “evolution myth” emerged, claiming white
      Europeans were the most advanced due to their governments, science, and
      rational thought. This belief was both inaccurate and discriminatory.


      ## Camels: Ships of the Desert


      While the Vikings relied on longboats to navigate the northern seas, Arab
      Bedouins used camels to cross vast deserts. Camels are uniquely suited for
      desert life. They can drink up to 40 gallons of water in minutes, allowing
      them to go for long periods without water. This ability to rehydrate
      quickly helps them survive in extreme conditions.


      Can you think of other fascinating camel adaptations?


      ## Challenging Historical Narratives


      For centuries, the West has told its version of history. Now, it’s time to
      question those narratives and explore different perspectives. By examining
      history critically, readers can determine which stories align with
      reality.
