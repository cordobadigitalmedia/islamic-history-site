      In the Middle Ages, two important civilizations began to shape the world:
      the Islamic civilization and the Western civilization. These civilizations
      started from two different groups of people: the Bedouins in the Arabian
      Peninsula and the Vikings from Northern Europe.


      The Arabs, inspired by a new message from God, spread quickly across Asia
      and Africa. In just one generation, they defeated powerful empires like
      the Persians and Romans. At the same time, the Vikings, famous for
      exploring and raiding, ruled Northern Europe for over 200 years. Their
      descendants, like the Normans and Rus, carried on their legacy. From these
      exciting events, the Islamic and Western civilizations grew.


      ## What Happened Before?


      The story of these civilizations covers about 1,400 years, but humans have
      been around much longer. Scientists believe humans have existed for at
      least 200,000 years, and some say even two million years, based on old
      tools found by archaeologists.


      ## Is All Western History True?


      In the 1800s, countries like Britain, France, and Germany started writing
      their own histories. They mixed true stories with made-up ones to make
      Europeans look like the best people. They said Europe’s history started
      with Ancient Greece, which they claimed was special for its science and
      thinking. Then they said this passed on to the Romans, who were praised
      for their laws even though they ruled harshly. They called the Middle Ages
      a bad time but said Europe became great again during the Renaissance by
      rediscovering Greek and Roman ideas. This story was taught in many schools
      around the world.


      ## Common Myths


      Some people think Western countries inherited everything great from Greece
      and Rome, but this isn’t true. Greece and Rome were Mediterranean
      civilizations connected to Asia and Africa. Western countries like Britain
      and Germany came from different tribes, not from Greece or Rome.


      People also think the Roman Empire ended in the 400s when Rome was
      invaded. This is only partly true. The western part of the empire ended,
      but the eastern part, with its capital in Constantinople, lasted until
      1453. History books call this part the “Byzantine Empire,” but the people
      who lived there never used that name.


      Maps also make Europe look separate from Asia, but Europe is actually part
      of Asia. Maps were drawn to make Europe look bigger and more important.


      In the 1800s, some Europeans believed an “evolution myth.” They thought
      white Europeans were the smartest and best people because of their science
      and governments. This belief was wrong and unfair.


      ## Camels: Ships of the Desert


      Vikings used longboats to explore cold seas, but Arab Bedouins used camels
      to travel across the desert. Camels are amazing animals that can survive
      in tough deserts. They can drink up to 40 gallons of water in just a few
      minutes! This helps them go a long time without water. When they find
      water, they drink as much as they can to stay hydrated.

      ## Looking at History Differently


      For a long time, the West told its version of history. Now, it’s time to
      look at history from all sides. Readers can think about these stories and
      decide what makes the most sense.
